Types of Questions for quiz?


4. 

-->
<!--
  Questions:
  Priority:
  Do i need to flex box the questions disaplay area? // Seems to work

  Secondary
  how will i display the scoreboard page? must be saved locally for the criteria
-->

<!--
  Things i will need to do ;
  -coding quiz challenge has "Cover page", "prompting" user to start, // got it
  probaly same methods to set up questions, but probably based on if else statements
  -set up flex box for highscores and timer ( timer may be appended in?)
  -make more questions for quiz
  -if statements for when question answered incorrectly, will reduce time by TBD
  -declare vars and hook into html via javascript
  -may need function to run thru questions and possibly a for loop to run thru questions
  -need keydown events for the questions answers.
