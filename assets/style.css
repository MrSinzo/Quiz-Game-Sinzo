Types of Questions for quiz?

-->
<!--
  Questions:

<!--
  Things i will need to do ;
  -set up flex box for highscores and timer ( timer may be appended in?)
  -make more questions for quiz
  -if statements for when question answered incorrectly, will reduce time by TBD
  -declare vars and hook into html via javascript
  -may need function to run thru questions and possibly a for loop to run thru questions
  -need keydown events for the questions answers.
