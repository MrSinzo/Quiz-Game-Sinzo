## What is it?
This is a quick little quiz on coding that will briefly test your introductory knowledge about coding and some general quirks within the coding world.  

## Why did I make this?

This doesnt really solve anyones problem except in the case of training your mind for the correct answers to these few questions. ( More will be implemented in the future, with an increased timer that reflects the added questions )


## How did I go about building this?
A small mix of HTML, and a ton (And i mean a ton ) of JavaScript were used and carefully constructed so that each question is clickable with a "view past high score" button to check your progress
